## Coursera-Web-Developer
This respository is mainly used for my front-end technology learning.  Just want to use Github to record my way to learn `HTML5`, `CSS3` and `Javascript`, etc. The whole project is based on an course on `Cousera.org`: [HTML,CSS and Javascirpt for Web Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/), taught by Mr.Yaakov Chaikin in JohnHopskin University. I will upload all my course code in the Github, and by the way, it will train me in using `Git` to record my code. Well, let's have a try in web development!
